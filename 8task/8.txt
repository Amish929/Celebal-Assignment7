Task: Apply gates to the pipeline.

✅ STEP 1: Create an Environment
Go to your Azure DevOps project
🔗 https://dev.azure.com

In the left menu, click:
Pipelines > Environments

Click + New environment

Name it something like:production

Click Create

✅ STEP 2: Add an Approval Gate (Check) to the Environment
After the environment is created, click its name (e.g., production)

On the top right, click “...” (More options) > Approvals and checks

Click + Add check → Select Approvals

Add your own user (your name/email) as an approver
✅ You can also add others if needed

Click Create and then Save

📌 Now your environment has a gate! Before any pipeline stage runs that uses this environment, it will pause and wait for approval.

✅ Result:
The Release stage in your YAML pipeline will now pause and wait for your approval

Go to Pipelines > Environments > prod to Approve when needed
