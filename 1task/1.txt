Task: Create a project with different user groups and implement group policies.

✅ Prerequisites
You must have an Azure DevOps account: https://dev.azure.com

You must be an Organization Owner or Project Admin to manage users and permissions.

🟢 Step 1: Sign in to Azure DevOps
Go to: https://dev.azure.com

Sign in with your Microsoft account.

🟢 Step 2: Create a New Project
On the left, click on “New Project”.

Fill in the form:

Project name: e.g., UserGroupsDemo

Visibility: Private

Leave other options as default

Click Create.

🟢 Step 3: Go to Project Settings
Once the project is created, scroll to the bottom left.

Click Project settings.

🟢 Step 4: Create User Groups
In Project Settings, go to Permissions > Create a custom group.

Click on New Group:

Group Name: e.g., Developers, Testers, Admins

Description: e.g., Group for development team

Click Create

Repeat this step to create all required groups.

🟢 Step 5: Add Users to Groups
Go to Organization Settings (top right gear icon).

Under Users, click + Add users.

Enter the email(s) of users (can be dummy/test accounts if you're practicing).

Choose their access level (Basic/Stakeholder).

After adding users:

Go to Project Settings > Permissions

Select your group (e.g., Developers)

Click Members > Add

Select users to add to that group


🟢 Step 6: Set Group Policies (Permissions)
In Project Settings > Permissions, click on the group (e.g., Testers)

You’ll see a list of permission settings (like Read, Edit, Delete).

Adjust permissions:

For Testers, maybe allow View work items, but deny Edit code

For Developers, allow Contribute to repos

For Admins, allow full control

To change permission:

Click the dropdown next to the permission → Select Allow or Deny

🟢 Step 7: Verify Policies
Log in as one of the users you added (or ask your friends to try if they were added).

Try to access repos, boards, pipelines, etc.

Confirm the permissions match the policy (e.g., testers can’t edit code).
