Task: Apply branch policies such that only the project administrator can access the master branch; contributors cannot.

✅ Goal:
Restrict the master branch so:

✅ Only Project Admins can push changes.

❌ Contributors (e.g., Developers group) cannot push or create pull requests directly to master.


🟢 1. Go to Your Azure DevOps Project
Sign in to https://dev.azure.com.

Click your organization > select your project (e.g., UserGroupsDemo).

🟢 2. Open Repos > Branches
On the left side menu, click Repos.

Then click Branches.

Look for the master branch (or main, depending on naming).

Hover over the master branch and click the 3 dots (...) > Branch policies.

🟢 3. Set Branch Security
On the Branch Policies page, scroll down and click Security.

You’ll see a list of groups like:

Project Administrators

Contributors

Readers

[Any custom group]

🟢 4. Deny Access to Contributors
Click on Contributors.

Find these permissions:

Contribute → set to Deny

Force push (rewrite history & delete) → Deny

Create branch → optional, deny if needed

Click Save changes.

🔒 Now Contributors cannot push to master or create pull requests into it.

🟢 5. Confirm Admins Can Access
Go back to Branch security.

Click on Project Administrators.

Make sure:

Contribute → Allow

Force push → (can be set to Not set or Allow)

Save if needed


🧪 6. Test the Permissions (Verify)
Try to log in as a Contributor group user (or another test account).

Open the repo, go to the master branch.

Try to edit a file or push changes via Git:

❌ It will say permission denied.

Try the same as an Admin:

✅ Changes will go through.
