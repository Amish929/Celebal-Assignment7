✅ What Are Work Items?
Work items in Azure Boards represent:

📝 User stories

🛠️ Tasks

🐞 Bugs

📦 Features

These are trackable units of work that can be linked to:

Commits

Branches

Pull Requests

Pipelines (builds/releases)

🔹 PART 1: Create a Work Item
Go to your Azure DevOps Project

Navigate to Boards > Work Items

Click + New Work Item

Choose Task or User Story

Fill in details:

Title: Implement login feature

Assign to: yourself

Area path: leave as default

Click Save

✅ STEP 1: Create a Work Item
If not done already:

✅ Make sure to include #42 — your work item ID
✅ You can also use Related #42 if you don’t want to auto-close it

Click Commit

✅ STEP 3: Wait for Pipeline to Run
If you have a CI trigger (like trigger: master), the pipeline will run automatically.

✅ STEP 4: View Linked Work Item in Pipeline Run
Go to Pipelines > Pipelines

Click on your latest pipeline run

In the Summary tab, scroll down to find:Associated work items

✅ You should see:#42 - Login feature

🔹 PART 3: Verify Work Item Link in Pipeline Run
Once code is pushed:

Go to Pipelines > Pipelines

Your pipeline should auto-trigger (CI)

Click the latest run

In the Summary, scroll down to “Associated work items”

✅ You’ll see #42 – Implement login feature linked to the pipeline run.
