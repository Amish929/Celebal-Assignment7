Task: Apply security on branches so that contributors can create a pull request but cannot directly merge code to master.

🎯 Objective
| Role              | Action                          | Permission |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Contributors  | Create PR to `master`           | ✅ Allowed  |
| Contributors  | Push/Merge directly to `master` | ❌ Denied   |
| Project Admin | Full access                     | ✅ Allowed  |

🔹 Step 1: Go to Repos > Branches
In Azure DevOps, go to your Project

Click on the left menu:
Repos > Branches


🔹 Step 2: Locate the master Branch
Find the branch named master (or main if you're using that)

Hover over it, click the 3 dots (…)

Select Branch security

🔹 Step 3: Set Permissions for Contributors
Now you’ll see the security settings for this branch.

On the right, click Add user or group

Search and add:
Contributors

Update permissions for Contributors like this:
| Permission                             | Set To                |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Contribute                         | ❌ Deny                |
| Contribute to pull request         | ✅ Allow               |
| Create branch                      | ✅ Allow    (optional) |
| Force push (rewrite history)       | ❌ Deny                |
| Manage permissions                 | ❌ Not set             |
| Bypass policies when pushing       | ❌ Deny                |
| Bypass policies when completing PR | ❌ Deny                |

📌 This setup ensures:

Contributors can’t push directly

But can contribute through PRs

🔹 Step 4: Verify Project Administrators Can Push
Back in Branch security, click Add user or group

Add your admin user or group (e.g., Project Administrators)

Set:
| Permission                             | Set To  |
| -------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Contribute                         | ✅ Allow |
| Bypass policies when pushing       | ✅ Allow |
| Bypass policies when completing PR | ✅ Allow |

🔹 Step 5: Save and Test
Ask a test contributor to push → ❌ Should be rejected

Ask them to create PR → ✅ Should work

Admin can still push directly → ✅ Works

🧪 Testing Flow (Verify Your Setup)
| Action by Contributor    | Expected Outcome |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- |
| Git push to `master`     | ❌ Rejected       |
| Create PR to `master`    | ✅ Allowed        |
| Admin pushes to `master` | ✅ Allowed        |
