Task: Apply a pull request.

✅ Prerequisites
You must have:

A project in Azure DevOps

A repository with at least two branches (master and a feature branch)

Some code changes in the feature branch

🔹 Step 1: Go to Azure DevOps Repos
Visit: https://dev.azure.com

Select your Organization → your Project

On the left, go to Repos > Files


🔹 Step 2: Create a Feature Branch (if not already done)
In Repos > Files, make sure you're on master

Click the Branch dropdown → Select + New branch

Name it feature-01 (or any name)

Set source branch as master

Click Create branch

🔹 Step 3: Make Code Changes in the New Branch
While in the new branch (feature-01), select a file (e.g., README.md)

Click Edit → Make a small change (e.g., add your name)

Click Commit → Add a message like “Updated README”

🔹 Step 4: Create a Pull Request
After committing, you'll see a banner: “Create a pull request” – click it
OR go to Repos > Pull requests > New pull request

Set the following:

Source branch: feature-01

Target branch: master

Add a title and description

Optionally, add reviewers (e.g., teammates)

Click Create

🔹 Step 5: Complete the Pull Request
Wait for any build validation to complete (if configured)

Click Complete (or Approve > Complete if reviews are enabled)

You can:

Choose Squash commit or Rebase

Delete source branch (optional)

Click Complete merge

✅ Your changes are now merged into master.
